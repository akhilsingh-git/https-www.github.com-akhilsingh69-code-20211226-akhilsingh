Problem Statement
Given the CSV weight-height.csv(close to 100000 Entries generated by online data generator.com) as input with a person's weight and height parameters, we need to do the following:
1) Open CSV programmatically using Python
2) Clean and repair data programmatically, e.g. Remove all unnecessary values, characters and spaces, delete invalid lines
3) Calculate BMI (body mass index) with formula 1, BMI category and health risk from table 1 of the person and add this as 3 new columns
4) Calculate the total number of people who are overweight using the ranges in the BMI category column in Table 1, verify that these are consistently programmed, and add other observations to the documentation
5)	Save it as a CSV file OutputBMI.csv

Formula 1 - BMI
BMI(kg/m2) = mass(kg) / height(m)2
The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m2) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg) divided by your height in meters squared (m)2. For example, if you are 175cm (1.75m) in height and 75kg in weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg / (1.75m²) = 24.49kg/m²
Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category	BMI Range (kg/m2)	Health risk
Underweight	18.4 and below	Malnutrition risk
Normal weight	18.5 - 24.9	Low risk
Overweight	25 - 29.9	Enhanced risk
Moderately obese	30 - 34.9	Medium risk
Severely obese	35 - 39.9	High risk
Very severely obese	40 and above	Very high risk
